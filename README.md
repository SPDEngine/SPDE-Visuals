# SPDE-Visuals

*This is a preliminary repository and will be improved in the future*

A collection of high-quality visuals, illustrations, and figures related to Stochastic Partial Differential Equations (SPDEs). Designed for use in academic posters, presentations, and publications. This repository aims to serve as a resource for researchers, students, and educators in the field of SPDEs and applied mathematics.

## Contents

1. **Propagation of the Tall Peaks of the Stochastic Heat Equations**:
   - Visualizes the behavior and dynamics of peak propagation in stochastic heat equations.
   - Includes high-resolution images and data files for further exploration.
   - [View here](./Peak-propogation).

2. **AI-Generated Images for Presentations**:
   - Contains AI-generated images that explore abstract and mathematical concepts.
   - Used in academic presentations to highlight key ideas.
   - [View here](./Some_images_by_AI).
