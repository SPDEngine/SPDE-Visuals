# SPDE-Visuals
A collection of high-quality visuals, illustrations, and figures related to Stochastic Partial Differential Equations (SPDEs). Designed for use in academic posters, presentations, and publications. This repository aims to serve as a resource for researchers, students, and educators in the field of SPDEs and applied mathematics.


1. Propagation of the tall peaks of the stochastic heat equations: [here](./Peak-propogation)
2. Some AI generated images that I used in my past talks: [here](./Some_images_by_AI)

Here is a sample Beamer slide from a presentation I delivered previously, which incorporated these images: [pdf](./Talk-LeChen-AMS_GeorgiaTech.pdf)
