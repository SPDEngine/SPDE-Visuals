# SPDE-Visuals

*This is a preliminary repository and will be improved in the future*

A collection of high-quality visuals, illustrations, and figures related to Stochastic Partial Differential Equations (SPDEs). Designed for use in academic posters, presentations, and publications. This repository aims to serve as a resource for researchers, students, and educators in the field of SPDEs and applied mathematics.
