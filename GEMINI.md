# SPDE-Visuals

## Directory Overview

This directory acts as a repository for high-quality visuals, illustrations, and figures related to **Stochastic Partial Differential Equations (SPDEs)**. It is intended to be a resource for researchers, students, and educators who need visual aids for academic posters, presentations, and publications.

The content is primarily non-code, consisting of images (JPEG, PNG, EPS), documents (PDF), and raw data files (DAT).

## Key Files and Directories

### 1. `Peak-propogation/`
This directory contains scientific visualizations focusing on the **propagation of tall peaks** in stochastic heat equations, specifically starting from a localized initial condition (Dirac delta).

*   **Naming Convention:**
    *   `Delta`: Indicates Dirac delta initial condition.
    *   `L{number}`: Represents the parameter Lambda ($\lambda$) and its value (e.g., `L0`, `L10`).
    *   `cut`: Indicates the plot is truncated at a vertical height of 500.
    *   `neg`: Indicates a dark background version.
*   **File Formats:**
    *   `.jpeg`: For quick previews.
    *   `.pdf` / `.eps`: Vector formats for high-resolution publications (LaTeX).
    *   `.dat`: Raw data files for custom analysis or replotting.

### 2. `Some_images_by_AI/`
This directory contains artistic and abstract interpretations of mathematical and physical concepts generated by AI tools (primarily MidJourney).

*   **Themes:**
    *   **Stochastic Heat Equation (SHE):** Visuals of heat flow, intermittency, and chaotic behavior.
    *   **Cosmic/Universe:** Abstract representations of cosmic forces, black holes, and the universe.
    *   **Nature:** Forests, mushrooms (illustrating intermittency/clustering), and weather phenomena.
*   **Usage:** These are best suited for title slides, conceptual illustrations, or engaging audience interest in presentations.

### 3. Root Files
*   **`Talk-LeChen-AMS_GeorgiaTech.pdf`**: A sample Beamer presentation demonstrating how these visuals can be effectively incorporated into an academic talk.
*   **`README.md`**: The general entry point describing the repository's purpose.

## Usage Guidelines

Since this is a resource repository, there are no build or run commands.

1.  **Browse:** Navigate the directories to find visuals relevant to your specific topic (e.g., specific $\lambda$ values in `Peak-propogation` or conceptual art in `Some_images_by_AI`).
2.  **Integration:**
    *   **LaTeX/Beamer:** Use the `.pdf` or `.eps` files for the highest quality.
    *   **PowerPoint/Web:** Use the `.jpeg` or `.png` files.
3.  **Data Analysis:** Use the `.dat` files in `Peak-propogation/` if you need to generate custom plots or perform further numerical analysis on the peak propagation data.
