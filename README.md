# SPDE-Visuals

*This is a preliminary repository and will be improved in the future*

A collection of high-quality visuals, illustrations, and figures related to Stochastic Partial Differential Equations (SPDEs). Designed for use in academic posters, presentations, and publications. This repository aims to serve as a resource for researchers, students, and educators in the field of SPDEs and applied mathematics.

## Repository contents

1. **Propagation of the Tall Peaks of the Stochastic Heat Equations**:
   - Visualizes the behavior and dynamics of peak propagation in stochastic heat equations.
   - Includes high-resolution images and data files for further exploration.
   - [View here](./Peak-propogation).

2. **AI-Generated Images for Presentations**:
   - Contains AI-generated images that explore abstract and mathematical concepts.
   - Used in academic presentations to highlight key ideas.
   - [View here](./Some_images_by_AI).

---

## How to use

- Browse the `Peak-propogation` folder to explore visualizations related to the stochastic heat equation.
- Use the `Some_images_by_AI` folder for presentation-ready visuals and abstract images.
- Refer to the accompanying references for further context and understanding.

## How to contribute

Contributions of new figures, animations, or small fixes are very welcome.

- Open a pull request or issue briefly describing what you are adding or changing.
- Place new assets in an appropriate folder (`Peak-propogation`, `Some_images_by_AI`, or a new subfolder with a short `README.md`).
- Use descriptive, ASCII-only filenames without spaces (follow patterns such as `MJ_*`, `chenle02_*`, `Nano_Banana_Pro_*`, `Sora_*`).
- Update the relevant README to include your new material (link + embedded preview) and mention the tool used to generate it (e.g., MidJourney, Gemini 3, Sora@OpenAI).
- Keep file sizes reasonable for GitHub; compress or downscale very large images or videos when possible.
- By contributing, you agree that your additions are compatible with the repository’s [CC0 1.0](./LICENSE) dedication.

For more contributor details, see `AGENTS.md` in the repository root.
